In this project, a SMPM servo motor with the following specs. will be designed by aiming high efficiency and low inertia. 
Analytical calculations will be given and some iterations will be made in order to optimize the size and dimensions of the machine. 
Finally, by using Finite Element Analysis tool the machine will be verified.

Power Rating: 1 kW
Rated Speed: 3000 rpm
Rated Voltage: 400 V l-l
